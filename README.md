## 
Cuda-10.2 required locally, if not present run the script to install
    
    sh install_cuda10.2_local.sh

## 
To run a lander sample without manual installations simply run

    source automate_rmanet.sh
    
## Prerequisite Installation
The code has been tested with Python3.8, PyTorch 1.6 and Cuda 10.2:

    conda create --name rmanet
    conda activate rmanet
    conda install pytorch=1.6.0 torchvision=0.7.0 cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch
    conda install -c conda-forge igl

Build the cuda extension:

    python build_cuda.py

## Usage

### Pre-trained Models
Download the [pre-trained models](https://wanquanf.github.io/rmanet_pretrained.html) and put the models in the *[YourProjectPath]/pre_trained* folder. 

### Run the registration
To run registration for a single sample, you can run:

    python inference.py --weight [pretrained-weight-path] --src [source-obj-path] --tgt [target-obj-path] --iteration [iteration-number] --device_id [gpu-id] --if_nonrigid [1 or 0]

The last argument *--if_nonrigid* represents if the translation between the source and target is non-rigid (1) or rigid (0). Registration results are listed in the folder named *source_deform_results*, including the deforming results of different stages. We have given a collection of samples in *[YourProjectPath]/samples*, and you can run the registration for them by:
    
    sh inference_samples.sh
